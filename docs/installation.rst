Installation
------------

Official releases are available via `Pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/secsgem>`_ repository.
The easiest way to install these is using a package manager like pip:: 

    $ pip install secsgem

In order to use the current development code, which might be instable at times, use the git repository directly::

    $ pip install git+git://github.com/bparzella/secsgem
